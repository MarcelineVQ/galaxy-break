I got the console input and output with a partial input buffer to all work today. The only trouble was that at first I forgot about the `-threaded` flag that needs to be passed to GHC to make things work. Without that the whole program works in a single thread I guess, which doesn't allow the IO to interleave properly. What happened was that the counting thread just kept counting, but its output wouldn't appear until the user pressed a key, which let the readOneChar call return from foreign land so GHC could interrupt the thread and print the counter.

Anyway, with that fixed things look good to start setting it up so that there's perhaps a TChan of outgoing messages. Each thread could just do its own printing I guess. Or perhaps we'd want a really complex setup where different "parts" of the system could log info, which goes into a rolling Sequence and also gets possibly printed to the screen depending on the user's current alert level set for that part of the system. It can get all kinds of crazy I guess, so we should probably keep it simple. "Always write the usage code *first*, before you try to write the rest"; It's good advice to stick with.

We want at least a little abstraction over things though, so that the process of creating a worker and having it be able to give output is a bit cleaner. We also want to have a reasonable command input history, and to allow for the idea of tab completion.

We also want a way to measure time within the game, and a way to start and stop the passage of time.
