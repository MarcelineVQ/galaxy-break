I'm going to star recording my thoughts about the development of galaxy break as I go along. I'm not sure this will be interesting to anyone but myself, but oh well.

Starting with a simple Main.hs, I'm going to break it off into a library portion and an executable portion in the project. In the process, I think we can dump the "completeReadChar" function, which I'll record here in case I ever need it later.

```haskell
{-| Does the complete setup and tear down to read a single, unbuffered keypress
in the windows console. It's probably overkill to save and restore the mode every
single key press, and so this is currently kept only for reference.
-}
completeReadChar :: IO CChar
completeReadChar = [C.block| char {
    // SetConsoleMode
    // https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686033(VS.85).aspx
    // INPUT_RECORD struct
    // https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683499(v=vs.85).aspx
    // KEY_EVENT_RECORD struct
    // https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684166(v=vs.85).aspx
    // Virtual-Key Codes
    // https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx
    // This code is based on a c++ help forum answer:
    // http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/3329/
    DWORD        mode;
    HANDLE       hstdin;
    INPUT_RECORD inrec;
    DWORD        count;
    char         result = '\0';
    
    hstdin = GetStdHandle( STD_INPUT_HANDLE );
    if (hstdin == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE || !GetConsoleMode(hstdin, &mode) || !SetConsoleMode(hstdin, 0))
        return result;
    
    //FlushConsoleInputBuffer( hstdin );

    // Wait for a single key press
    do
        ReadConsoleInput( hstdin, &inrec, 1, &count );
    while ((inrec.EventType != KEY_EVENT) || !inrec.Event.KeyEvent.bKeyDown);

    // Remember which key the user pressed
    result = inrec.Event.KeyEvent.uChar.AsciiChar;

    // This is how we could wait for a key to be released.
    // However, doing this makes the input very slow and unresponsive.
    // the user hasn't always released enough of the last key to fire this event
    // before they've begun to type the next key.
    //do
    //    ReadConsoleInput( hstdin, &inrec, 1, &count );
    //while ((inrec.EventType != KEY_EVENT) || inrec.Event.KeyEvent.bKeyDown);

    // Restore the original console mode before leaving this func.
    SetConsoleMode( hstdin, mode );

    return result;
    } |]
```

So I cleaned things up and put them in a Control.Console.Win32 module, then I wanted to move them around so that the platform parts would be in Control.Console.Win32, and the parts on top would be in a platform agnostic Control.Console thing using the platform specific primitives. Cool and all, but it turns out there's a goofy bug in cabal where the CPP flag (Win32 in this case) will get taken out of the final code, even if it's a substring in a word. So `Control.Console.Win32` was getting converted to `Control.Console.`, and when you try to import that within a module called `Control.Console` then cabal gets confused, ends up thinking that a module is importing itself, and crashing out with a perplexing error message. The thing is, it ALSO wasn't detecting that `Control.Console.` is simply an invalid module name, which would have made it much clearer what was going on. Thanks to MarcelineVQ for figuring out the fix, and also thanks to geekosaur for explaining *why* changing the name of the CPP flag fixes things, and also for explaining what to send as a bug report to cabal.

With that all figured out, I was able to split the platform dependent code away from the code built on top of it.
